# Dileitte - A milstone project

## Table of contents


## Introduction

This website was designed to give access to people who want the experience of bespoke botanics without having to go out of their way to make a day special for their loved ones.

Although there are a wide variety of businesses that offer the same service, this website was built to not only offer people personalisation of flowers, but also offering pre-made designs to make their journey a little easier when making that special day more memorable.

This website could also have further commercial applications given there is a large market for botanics and smaller complimentary gifts.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

#### Scope
A scope was defined in order to clearly identify what needed to be done in order to align features with the strategy previously defined. This was broken into two categories:
- **Content Requirements**
     - The user will be looking for:
          - Flower care information
          - Product information
          - Supporting imagery/videos
          - Contact details
          - Social Links

          - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information/product they want
          - Be able to find links to external sites in order to:
               - Explore other options
               - Be able to look at supporting content
               - Contact the website host via their chosen channel of communication

#### Skeleton 
Wireframe mockups were created in a [Balsamiq] (https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) with providing a positive user experience in mind:

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The main colours used throughout the website are Eerie Black, Beaver with accents of Bone and Seasalt. 

These chosen colours were because they are typically found in nature, and are complementary to the natural colours of flowers and plants. They also provoke feelings of self-care and serenity.  

#### Typography
The pairing of the fonts [Volkorn](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Volkorn "Link to Volkorn Google Font") and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat "Link to Montserrat Google Font") is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure. 

For features that needed to be highlighted, such as the logo text and subheadings, the font [Limelight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Limelight "Link to Limelight Google Font") and [Satisfy](http://fots.google.come/specimen/Satisfy "Link to Satisfy Google Font") was used, with Sans Serif as the fallback.

#### Imagery
The selected imagery is modern and cohesively aesthetic, reflecting the style and feel of the website. It is also supporting of any informative text presented. 

The imagery is catching and visually represents the theme of the website.

All imagery provides alternative text to be used in the event that the element cannot be rendered.

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
- The **Header** contains a conventionally placed **logo** in the top center of the page (whereby by clicking this will redirect users back to the home page) and **navigation bar** in the top center of the page.
- The **Footer** contains the appropriate **social media icons**, linking users to the appropriate social media site. On smaller screens the Footer decreases in size relative to the other elements on the page.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar shrinks in size and remains in the center of the webpage.

### Testing 


### Existing Features
- **Header Logo** - Appearing on every page for brand recognition. Clicking the logo will return the users to the home page, as expected.
- **Header Navigation Bar** - Appearing on every page for a consistently easy and intuitive navigable system.
- **Social Icons** - Appearing on every page in the footer, the icons are appropriate representations of the Social Media platforms, linking to preferred social media platform. 
- **Contact Form** - A contact form is used on the Contact us page, in order to provide a point of contact for the user. The form is not valid and on pressing submit the form will reset.

- **[Home Page](index.html "Home Page")** - Provide an eyecatching home image, with relevant information on who the website host is and what the website is about.
