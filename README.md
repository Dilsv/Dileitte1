## Table of contents


## Introduction

This website was designed to give access to people who want the experience of bespoke botanics without having to go out of their way to make a day special for their loved ones.

Although there are a wide variety of businesses that offer the same service, this website was built to not only offer people personalisation of flowers, but also offering pre-made designs to make their journey a little easier when making that special day more memorable.

This website could also have further commercial applications given there is a large market for botanics and smaller complimentary gifts.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
