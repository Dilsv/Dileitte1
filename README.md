# Dileitte - A milstone project

## Table of contents


## Introduction

This website was designed to give access to people who want the experience of bespoke botanics without having to go out of their way to make a day special for their loved ones.

Although there are a wide variety of businesses that offer the same service, this website was built to not only offer people personalisation of flowers, but also offering pre-made designs to make their journey a little easier when making that special day more memorable.

This website could also have further commercial applications given there is a large market for botanics and smaller complimentary gifts.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

#### Scope
A scope was defined in order to clearly identify what needed to be done in order to align features with the strategy previously defined. This was broken into two categories:
- **Content Requirements**
     - The user will be looking for:
          - Flower care information
          - Product information
          - Supporting imagery/videos
          - Contact details
          - Social Links
- **Functionality Requirements**
     - The user will be able to:
          - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information/product they want
          - Be able to find links to external sites in order to:
               - Explore other options
               - Be able to look at supporting content
               - Contact the website host via their chosen channel of communication

#### Structure
The information architecture was organized in a **hierarchial tree structure** in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results: 

! [Sitemap] (assets/readme-files/tree-structure.png)

#### Skeleton 
Wireframe mockups were created in a [Balsamiq] (https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) with providing a positive user experience in mind:

Home Page:
! [Home Page wireframe] (assets/readme-files/wireframe-home.png "Home Page wireframe")

Bio Page:
! [Flowers page] (assets/readme-files/wireframe-flowers.png "Flowers Page wireframe)

Press Kit Page:
! [Contact Us Page] (assets/readme-files/wireframe-contact-us.png)

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The main colours used throughout the website are Eerie Black, Beaver with accents of Bone and Seasalt. 

These chosen colours were because they are typically found in nature, and are complementary to the natural colours of flowers and plants. They also provoke feelings of self-care and serenity.  

#### Typography
The pairing of the fonts [Volkorn](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Volkorn "Link to Volkorn Google Font") and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat "Link to Montserrat Google Font") is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure. 

For features that needed to be highlighted, such as the logo text and subheadings, the font [Limelight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Limelight "Link to Limelight Google Font") and [Satisfy](http://fots.google.come/specimen/Satisfy "Link to Satisfy Google Font") was used, with Sans Serif as the fallback.

#### Imagery
The selected imagery is modern and cohesively aesthetic, reflecting the style and feel of the website. It is also supporting of any informative text presented. 

The imagery is catching and visually represents the theme of the website.

All imagery provides alternative text to be used in the event that the element cannot be rendered.

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
- The **Header** contains a conventionally placed **logo** in the top center of the page (whereby by clicking this will redirect users back to the home page) and **navigation bar** in the top center of the page.
- The **Footer** contains the appropriate **social media icons**, linking users to the appropriate social media site. On smaller screens the Footer decreases in size relative to the other elements on the page.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar shrinks in size and remains in the center of the webpage.

### Testing 
--------------------------------

### Existing Features
- **Header Logo** - Appearing on every page for brand recognition. Clicking the logo will return the users to the home page, as expected.
- **Header Navigation Bar** - Appearing on every page for a consistently easy and intuitive navigable system.
- **Social Icons** - Appearing on every page in the footer, the icons are appropriate representations of the Social Media platforms, linking to preferred social media platform. 
- **Contact Form** - A contact form is used on the Contact us page, in order to provide a point of contact for the user. The form is not valid and on pressing submit the form will reset.

- **[Home Page](index.html "Home Page")** - Provide an eyecatching home image, with relevant information on who the website host is and what the website is about. 
- **[Flowers Page](flowers.html "Flowers Page")** - Providing imagery on the different asortments and protection availible for this type of interest.
- **[Contact Us Page](contact.html "Contact Us Page")** - Providing a simple form to allow the user to contact the website host.

### Features to include in the future

- **Product Shop**
     - **Feature** - Set up a section where the user is able to build personalised assortments.
     - **Reason for not featuring in this release** - Need a wider variety of images or description of other flowers and plants.
- **Product Information and pricing** 
     - **Feature** - Set up a section beneath the flower images that provides pricing and the unique names of the bouquets.
     - **Reasons for not featuring in this release** - Need a detailed description for each flower featured in the bouquets as well as average pricing for specific styles.
- **Events Page**
     - **Feature** - Set up a page that offers a list of events the business caters for.
     - **Reasons for not featuring in this release** - Need a lot more visual aid to show examples of events and flower assortments for each event offered. To do this the developer needed to source pictures of multiple event photos from porfessional websites to add.

     ## Issues and Bugs 
The developer ran into a number of issues during the development of the websites, with the noteworthy ones listed below, along with solutions or ideas to implement in the future.

**Images Bug** - An inconsistency was detected later on with the images. On the page view some images were larger than others and weren't inline with eachother, making it less consistent. This wasn't solved as the images were different sizes by default. The solution to this is to keep images used the same size throughout to avoid incosistency.

**Social Links footer bug** - A bug was detected when adding the footer to the contact us page anf flowers page. The footer (social media icons) were inside the contact us form. This was solved by finding that there was a missing </div> that was causing the footer to be picked up in the body of the contact us form and adding </div> in the appropriate place. 

**Footer Issue on all pages** - A bug was detected when implementing the footer to be used for all pages. When looking on the ports the footer look disorientated and dimentions didn't reflect the codes in flowers.html and contact.html. [A `media query` was added however, it didnt give the desired result therefore the developer removed the footer colour in order to fix the bug]

**Contact Us form bug** - A bug was detected when testing the contact us form. You were able to put in one letter on the name field and you were also able to adjust the size of the comment box. This was fixed by adding a minimum character of 5 to the input fields giving the comment section a `resize: none;`.

**Media and Audio bug** - Upon uploading the youtube video the developer couldn't connect [This was fixed by implementing 'embed' within the url] however, the youtube media looks longer in length when the window is shrunk.

**Commits** - Whilst coding the developer had missed the important action of committing codes whilst building the webpage, when making small and substantial changes.

**Repository and Workspaces** - The developer had set up their workspaces incorrectly, only realising last minute as Gitpod began asking for billing information. The developer contacted tutor support and they helped carry the workspaces over however, due to the codes not being pushed even though they were committed, the repository didnt reflect the pages and files. To tackle this, the developer had to rewrite the code in parts and make sure to commit and push regularly to make it reflect into the new repository.

**Readme Files** - Upon writing the read.me file, the developer started editing the read.me through the repository, which caused conflict between the workspace and repository as it didnt allow to git push the work done. This was fixed with the help of a mentor.
